				Who we are
			</h2>
			<p>
				Horsham Digital Hub is designed to foster innovation, technological development and creativity in a supportive, entrepreneurial environment.
			</p>
			<p>
				Being positioned just 30 miles out of London, 20 miles from Brighton and within the increasingly influential Gatwick Diamond region, Horsham is ideally located to realise its potential as a serious player within the growing digital technology economy. It is already home to several award-winning IT companies and now needs a bigger voice and increased support to further those ambitions.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Horsham Digital Hub will promote and position Horsham as a centre for technical excellence that will benefit the local community by uniting businesses, education providers, the public sector, students and charities.

				Across these partnerships, the hub will offer opportunities for organisations and individuals to share knowledge and enhance skills, promote ideas and innovation, invite collaboration and networking, stimulate employment and retain talent, lobby on relevant tech topics and drive new agendas, and attract investment.
			</p>
			<p>
				As well as being a hothouse for technological innovation and ideas, the Digital Hub could stimulate growth in the form of physical urban regeneration and increased footfall to the town. It will also attract attention for highlighting the diversity of training and career opportunities in the STEM and digital industries, irrespective of gender, age and ability that can enable individuals to be active citizens in an increasingly technological society.
