In July 2015, members of the Horsham Digital initiative hosted a center for Young Rewired State's 'Festival of Code'. The event took place at the offices of Red River Software, where participants were given the opportunity to use technology to solve a problem using open data. Working with local artists, charities and businesses the participants were then given the tools and experience required to make their concepts a reality. During the last two days of the event the participants were then taken to Birmingham where they demonstrated their projects to judges and competed with thousands of other contestants.

The week was a huge success, with one of the teams managing to win an award and make headlines with their 'Intelligent Elephant Alarm Clock'. Should Young Rewired State choose to host a follow up event in 2016, Horsham Digital plans to run another center with a higher capacity.
